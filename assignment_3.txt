Why is normalization important? What problems occur if a database is not normalized?

Convert the following unnormalized data into 1NF:

Order_ID	Customer_Name	Products
101		Rahul		Laptop, Mouse


Normalization is done to remove redundancy from the database and maintain data integrity. This is done to avoid any anomaly during inserting, updating or deleting any record from the database.
Anomalies like - same data could be stored multiple times, deleting data in one table may lead to deletions of data in other connected table (though foreign key), etc.

1NF of given table - 

Order_ID	Customer_Name	Products
101		Rahul		Laptop
101		Rahul		Mouse
