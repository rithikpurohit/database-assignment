A query frequently runs:

SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE doctor_id = ?
AND appointment_date >= ?
AND appointment_date <= ?;

Propose a composite index
Explain column order choice.

So in this case we are querying 2 columns - doctor_id and appointment_date. Because this query runs frequently, we can make it faster by creating a composite index on both doctor_id and appointment_date. Because the doctor_id is unique (primary key), we will use it as the primary index, and the secondary index will be appointment_date.

CREATE INDEX idx ON Doctors (doctor_id, appointment_date);
