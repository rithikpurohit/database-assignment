Given the table: orders
id	user_id		status		created_at

Suggest appropriate indexes. Explain why you chose them?

So in orders table, we'll mostly query about order id or user id, so creating unique index on them makes sense.
Also we can also create a composite index on user id and created_at so that we can query on user id and sort by created_at.
